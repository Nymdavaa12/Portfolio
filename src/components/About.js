        I'm a designer turned full stack developer, passionate about React.js
        and Node.js. I excel in blending technical and visual aspects to craft
        exceptional digital products, prioritizing user experience, precise
        design, and optimized code.

        Since starting my web development journey in 2015, I've embraced
        challenges and kept up with the latest tech trends. Now in my early
        thirties, seven years in, I'm building cutting-edge web apps using
        Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase, and more.

        process, from ideation to execution. Off duty, you'll find me on
        Twitter, tracking startup journeys, or unwinding. Follow me for tech
